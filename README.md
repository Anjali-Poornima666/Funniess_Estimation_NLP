# Funniess_Estimation_NLP
With an idea inspired
from a competition task SemEval-2020
“Assessing Humor in Edited News Headlines”, the motivation for this project is
to build a model that has the ability to
predict the funniness of edited headlines,
thereby providing a way to automatically
detect humor. This paper describes the
implementation of three different deep
learning models namely, Feed Forward
Neural network, Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers
(BERT) and Recurrent Neural Network
on the humor dataset and compare the
results.
